## Enraged Rabbit : Carrot Feeder config file with config for {brd_type} mcu
##
## EASY-BRD Setup Notes:
## J6 Jumper setting:
## Option 1: Pins 2-3 and 4-5, i.e.  .[..][..]
##   This is for sensorless selector setup. Note that this enables the option disables the "extra"
##   switch so the toolhead sensor (if used) would have to be connected to the main mcu
## Option 2: Pins 1-2 and 4-5, i.e.  [..].[..]
##   It you are NOT using sensorless selector. The "extra" switch is enabled for other uses
##
## Fysetc Burrows ERB Setup Notes:
## No jumper configuration is required on this board
## Firmware install:
##   > make menuconfig (rpi2040, No bootloader)
##   > make
## Put card in boot loader mode: Press & Hold ‘BOOTSEL’ ; click ‘RST’ ; Release ‘BOOTSEL’
##   > make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003
